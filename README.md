# EDA-Fandango-Ratings
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? *Especially* if the same company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

## Goal:
Our goal here is to use our Pandas and visualization skills to see if we can come to the same conclusion as this [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets

### Completed notebook is available [here](https://github.com/HamzaBustanji/EDA-Fandango-Ratings/blob/main/Capstone-Project-Data-Visualization.ipynb).
